# CS231n-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision
I've just finished the course online and this repository contains my solutions to the assignments of the [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/schedule.html) course offered by Stanford University (Spring 2022).

Since I've passed the exam hold by TensorFlow team and got the [TensorFlow Developer Certificate](https://www.credential.net/54a119ef-4f74-4f8d-90c2-adcd4a2b0126#gs.p7wp1k), in this assignments, I implemented models whenever possible using PyTorch through which I learned and consolidate my skills on PyTorch framework.
