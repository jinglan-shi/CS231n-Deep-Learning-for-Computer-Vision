# CS231n-Deep-Learning-for-Computer-Vision
This repository contains my work and notes for the CS231n course on deep learning for computer vision offered by Stanford University. The course materials, including lecture slides, assignments, and notes, can be found on the [course website](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/schedule.html) course offered by Stanford University (Spring 2022).
